# hello-world-with-trees
My start in GitHub. Includes 3 of recursive trees.
The trees came with a turtle demo in my copy of Python 3.7.7. I rewrote them as part of learning Python.
Stree.py is a recursive tree that runs on a stack. Btree.py is a true recursive tree where the branch function calls itself twice. Rtree is mostly art object.
The turtle demo was an example of a python structure called a generator which I do not understand. I don't feel to bad about this as my 2 unornimented trees run faster than the demo with a generator.
