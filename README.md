# hello-world-with-trees
My start in GitHub. 
Includes 3 recursive python turtle trees. They were derived from the turtle tree demo in my copy of Python 3.7.7. 
Stree.py is a recursive tree that uses a stack. Btree.py is a true recursive tree that has a function that calls itself twice. Rtree.py is mainly an art object.
The Demo they were derived from is an example of a structure called a generator that I do not understand. I do not feel so bad about not understanding generators as my trees run faster than the demo.
